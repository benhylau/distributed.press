title: Our Approach
---

_Distributed Press_ is a proposal to build an open-source publishing tool for the distributed web. Our approach is to engage communities actively researching the many issues we face in content publishing today to create a tool that prioritizes content authors. In particular, we hope to learn from independent media that are practicing alternative publishing models, to investigate if and how the distributed web may augment this ecosystem.

Beginning this year, we interviewed activists and journalists who combat misinformation and censorship, founders of progressive platforms like Popula and Are.na, builders of open protocols from the IndieWeb and DWeb movement. Some of these interviews are published on [GitHub](https://github.com/benhylau/distributed.press/blob/master/interviews.md). As our project develops, we will continue to collaborate with these communities and many other neighbors.

If you are interested in having a conversation about possible ways we may collaborate, [please get in touch](mailto:hello@distributed.press)!
